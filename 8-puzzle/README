Solves the 8-puzzle with DFS, BFS, or A* algorithm, 
assuming the initial configuration is solvable
(no checks).
Produces a file "output.txt" with the moves to solve the puzzle and statistics.

It should also work with n-puzzles of higher dimension.

USAGE:

python2 puzzle.py [ALGORITHM] [CONFIGURATION]

where 
ALGORITHM can be one of bfs, dfs, ast
and
CONFIGURATION is a list of comma separated digits giving the initial configuration of the puzzle

EXAMPLE:

python2 puzzle.py bfs 5,6,3,7,4,2,1,8,0
